  "description": "<p>The National Institute of Statistics and Geography published on July 10, 2009, in the Official Journal of the Federation the Agreement for the use of the North American Industry Classification System (SCIAN). In this agreement, the use of SCIAN was made mandatory for all State Units (agencies) that generate or obtain economic statistics through the National Statistical and Geographical Information System. Its adoption was necessary to have a unique classifier that allows standardizing the economic information produced in the country. In this way, the \"Mexican Classification of Activities and Products\" was replaced.</p><p>SCIAN is a systematic classification of economic activities organized taking into account different criteria specific to the development of said activity:</p><ul><li>To which stage of economic activity they belong (primary, secondary, or tertiary)</li><li>Sector in which they are found (trade of goods, provision of services, etc.)</li><li>Detailed characteristics of the activity (what products they sell, whether food, furniture, cars, etc.; what services they offer, whether insurance, consulting, banking services, notaries, etc.)</li></ul><p>The recognition and use of SCIAN is important for the functioning of Visor Urbano. Out of a total of 1,059 business types or classes of economic activities contained in the catalog, 42% correspond to low-risk activities that do not pose a danger to citizens or impact the environment. Therefore, all these activities are likely to be developed by entrepreneurs and SMEs without excessive regulations.</p>"

# Translations

For translations we are using [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).

The translations files are stored in `/public/locales/[localeCode]/[nameSpace].json`.

Normally translations files get big and hard to maintain, this could impact page load times, so we are using multiple translations files to load only required translations in each page.

The translations files works in the web project and in the storybook documentation, so you can test the translations directly in storybook.

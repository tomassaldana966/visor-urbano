# Welcome to Visor Urbano

Discover **Visor Urbano** - the comprehensive municipal urban planning management system.

## Getting Started

Start your implementation by **creating a new instance**.

Or **try Visor Urbano immediately** with our **[quick setup tutorials](./getting-started/quick-setup.md)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
- [Python](https://python.org/downloads/) version 3.8 or above
- A server with minimum required specifications

## Generate a new installation

Run the installation command to generate a new Visor Urbano site:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Delivery-Associates/visor-urbano.git
cd visor-urbano
npm install
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Visor Urbano.

## Start your installation

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The `npm run start` command builds your site locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **automatically reloads** and displays your changes.
